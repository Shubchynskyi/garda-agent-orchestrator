# Changelog

## 1.4.1

### Extensible Review Catalog

- Added a guarded review catalog for built-in and repository-specific review lanes. Operators can inspect, validate, explain, create, update, enable, disable, bind, and order custom lanes through `garda review-catalog` and the local UI.
- Added profile-owned review states and dependency graphs. The effective catalog, lane policy, and launch order are frozen when a task starts, so later configuration changes cannot alter an active review cycle.
- Added a compatibility-preserving migration flow for existing workspaces. Missing catalog files continue to use the built-in review lanes, custom lanes remain disabled by default, and migration uses preview, confirmation, one-time receipt, transactional apply, audit, backup, and rollback controls.

### Faster And Safer Review Remediation

- Added authenticated `REUSE`, `DELTA`, and `FULL` remediation modes. Bounded fixes can receive a focused delta review when the original exhaustive review, scope lineage, policy snapshot, and evidence remain valid; ambiguous, stale, protected, oversized, or dependency-invalidated changes fall back to a full review.
- Hardened review reuse, dependency ordering, launch receipts, failed-launch recovery, post-review source-mutation detection, evidence-only remediation, and cross-cycle scope binding so stale or unrelated evidence cannot satisfy a current task.
- Added a controlled correction path for malformed reviewer output, including immutable input/output provenance, isolated retry artifacts, response reconstruction, and fail-closed handling for unsupported or tampered corrections.
- Added profile-driven follow-up task policies, safer grouped follow-up handling, review-limit enforcement, and more coherent recovery for interrupted, reopened, decomposed, remediated, or already-completed tasks.

### Workflow And Operator Experience

- Added declarative lifecycle-phase and workflow-settings manifests to keep CLI help, runtime routing, configuration, documentation, and UI behavior aligned.
- Added an authenticated test-first implementation lane for explicitly marked test-only expected failures, followed by the normal refreshed compile, validation, and review cycle after implementation.
- Improved optional quality-check routing: agents must complete the generated answers before execution, and remediated checks are rerun when their evidence is no longer current.
- Improved `next-step` diagnostics and routing for dynamic review lanes, remediation, scope recovery, closeout, full-suite retry, and review-skill selection while reducing repeated review-index and workspace reads.
- Added review-catalog and delta-review controls to the local dashboard, clearer task status markers, and better visibility into profile policies, decomposition, follow-up behavior, review execution modes, and closeout state.
- `garda uninstall` now preserves `TASK.md` by default. Removing the task queue requires the explicit `--keep-task-file no` override and reports recovery information unless backups are also explicitly skipped.

### Reliability And Compatibility

- Fixed clean-checkout release validation on Node 22 for Windows, isolated review-catalog tests from ignored materialized configuration, and made the Windows package-install performance ceiling resilient to shared-runner filesystem variance without weakening the functional timeout.
- Strengthened semantic-cycle rebind and resume transactions, mutation-journal recovery, lifecycle-event reconstruction, full-review reuse, correction rollback, materialized follow-up reconciliation, and frozen-policy handling across configuration drift.
- Fixed review-catalog transaction cleanup so lock-release failures are reported without throwing from `finally`, while simultaneous operation and cleanup failures retain both causes.
- Fixed downstream review and rule-pack validation for repositories that keep the task-mode artifact at an explicit non-default path; the supplied path remains constrained to the repository boundary.
- Added end-to-end coverage for review catalog schema, materialization, CLI and UI management, guarded compatibility migration, dynamic launch order, remediation modes, reports, and legacy workspace behavior.
- Existing workspaces remain compatible without a mandatory catalog migration. Profiles without an explicit remediation-mode policy remain on conservative full-review behavior until the operator deliberately migrates or configures them.

### Upgrade Notes

- After updating, run `garda review-catalog validate --target-root "."` to inspect the effective built-in and custom review configuration.
- Use `garda review-catalog migrate --target-root "."` only when you want to preview an explicit normalized catalog for a legacy workspace; the first call is read-only and does not enable custom lanes.
- Existing active task snapshots are not rewritten by catalog or profile changes. Start a new task cycle to adopt newly configured lanes, dependencies, or remediation policies.

## 1.3.0

### Workflow And Reviews

- Strengthened delegated review provenance from launch through receipt: clean-context identities, immutable launch inputs, serialized lane transitions, output hashes, findings validation, and failure recovery now remain bound to the current task cycle.
- Added deterministic reviewer coverage ledgers and exhaustive findings contracts. Reviewers must cover every assigned file, behavior boundary, and applicable category, continue after finding defects, and report distinct evidence-supported findings without an artificial quota.
- Added profile-level finding policies, guarded preview/apply flows, future-task-only policy snapshots, selective remediation evidence, and safer reuse rules for accepted review results.
- Replaced internal finding-policy and preset identifiers in the local UI with user-facing labels across all 20 language packs, clarified the review-failure cadence setting, and localized the not-due-yet quality-check state.
- Hardened coherent-cycle, dirty-baseline, split-WIP, protected-manifest, full-suite-repair, and post-completion recovery so interrupted work resumes through explicit scoped evidence instead of synthetic state.

### Performance And Test Reliability

- Reduced repeated `next-step` work by batching Git status, diff, index, tree, and object probes; sharing request-scoped workspace snapshots; caching immutable task-queue, review-history, runtime-metric, and toxin evidence; and avoiding full global status construction on ordinary navigator routes.
- Partitioned the largest review and gate test suites, bounded subprocess cleanup, improved Windows lock handling, and retained deterministic timeout and failure telemetry for focused and sharded runs.
- Kept runtime-mutation journal files out of task scope without suppressing user-owned lookalikes, and widened only test-harness observation deadlines so reviewer lock tests remain reliable under full-suite load.

### SQLite Projection

- Added a workspace-local SQLite catalog with canonical-first ingestion, generation-bound reconciliation, integrity checks, repair/rebuild commands, connection leases, bounded recovery, and deterministic fallback to canonical files.
- Adopted SQLite only for benchmark-qualified stress-tier bulk task-activity aggregation and added a hash-bound project-memory search index. Small and trust-sensitive paths remain on canonical readers; SQLite is still a disposable projection and never authorizes lifecycle, review, security, cleanup, configuration, or completion decisions.
- Kept Node 22 runtimes without embedded FTS5 fully supported: the capability probe now selects canonical-file fallback, while FTS5-dependent integration coverage runs only when the runtime provides that capability.

### Architecture, Security, And Release

- Split several gate, recovery, materialization, lifecycle, CLI, and report coordinators behind stable facades, added dependency-boundary enforcement, and tightened realpath containment and reviewer diagnostic redaction.
- Reduced the npm tarball to the compiled runtime and required assets, with clean install/invoke smoke coverage that does not require TypeScript, devDependencies, or a consumer build.
- Added deterministic offline package-surface scoring for file count, unpacked size, lifecycle scripts, and executable risk signals, including explicit rationale-bound baseline updates.
- Release readiness now rejects every pre-existing target tag, while the tag-triggered workflow rejects reruns and prior workflow runs for the same tag, verifies tag/version parity, and removes only its ephemeral local tag ref before running the same uniqueness proof; readiness also requires the changelog head and package-surface baseline to match the target version, preserves the released changelog tail against the prior version tag, and validates repository-relative links across all tracked Markdown documents.
- Preserved post-DONE audited content fingerprints after an exact task diff is committed, aligned every human-commit command surface with fresh timestamp confirmation, and synchronized release-preflight contract coverage with package-surface validation.
- Fixed POSIX absolute-path containment on Linux, hardened profile-lock release against replacement cleanup guards, preserved guarded file identity checks on Node 22 for Windows, and refreshed the vulnerable `brace-expansion` override.
- Removed the unreferenced legacy stack walkthrough set; current setup, run-method, workflow, CLI, and configuration guidance remains in the canonical documentation.

## 1.2.0

- Added the new optional quality checklist gate: before review, the agent can run a separate checklist-based quality pass and receive concrete follow-up items.
- Added configurable quality rules: they can be enabled, disabled, and edited through the UI (`garda ui --actions`).
- Improved `next-step` navigation: reduced the number of cases where the navigator could send the agent through an unnecessary extra review cycle.
- Improved review reuse: previous reviews are reused more carefully, with domain, lane, timing trust, full-suite binding, and telemetry checks, so reviews are not rerun unnecessarily while stale evidence is not accepted.
- Added normalized specialist-skill modes: `off`, `optional`, and `mandatory`. Legacy `advisory`/`required`/`strict` values remain readable for compatibility. Custom specialist skills, pack recommendations, and UI settings were improved.
- Refined the local UI: workflow settings, quality gate, profiles, review limits, task reset actions, and system state are clearer.

## 1.1.1

### Local UI
- Restored the guarded Compile-gate command editor in `garda ui --actions`, placed next to Full-suite command and routed through the audited `garda workflow set --compile-gate-command` confirmation path.
- Setup handoff, successful `agent-init`, and `garda status` now surface `garda ui --actions` as a separate UI recommendation for inspecting workspace state and guarded allow-listed settings without replacing the lifecycle next command.

### Install, Update, And Package Safety
- Preserved existing `TASK.md` task rows and user-owned notes when install/update refreshes the managed template, including overwrite-style setup paths.
- Removed public custom deployed-bundle selection through `--bundle-name` and `GARDA_BUNDLE_NAME`; install/update now use the fixed `garda-agent-orchestrator` bundle directory.
- Centralized behavior-bearing deployed-bundle path construction through shared bundle helpers for gates, reports, preprompt context, and guarded local UI actions.

### Task Workflow And Quality Gates
- Reduced the shipped optional quality-check baseline to broadly applicable rules and moved Garda implementation-specific checks out of the universal default rule set.
- Preserved Garda-specific quality checks as source-checkout custom rules during both stale-config migration and fresh workflow-config materialization.
- Localization file changes no longer trigger unnecessary review types.
- Kept mutable closeout evidence such as `TASK.md` out of review-reuse fingerprints so post-review task-status sync does not force redundant reviewer cycles, while preserving provider instruction surfaces in review scope.

## 1.1.0

### Operator Highlights
- Added and expanded `garda ui` as a local dashboard for task inspection, workflow/settings visibility, instructions, lazy task details, and guarded safe actions.
- `next-step` is the main task-loop navigator and now prints the next mandatory command, review policy, full-suite state, missing artifacts, review trust, compact invalidation diagnostics, and clearer recovery guidance.
- Setup output now avoids internal agent-only blocks and ends with a clearer agent-init handoff, plus a recommendation to use `garda ui` for command discovery.
- Project-memory readiness and impact evidence are now visible in setup/update, status, doctor, preprompt, task audit, and final closeout.
- Agent-init now explains ordinary document path exceptions and optional skill handling more clearly, including when extra project-specific skills should be suggested or installed.
- Human output for setup, update, doctor, task events, stats, audit summary, and closeout is more readable, with colorized human surfaces where useful and clean JSON output preserved for automation.

### Install, Update, And Package Safety
- Garda now targets Node.js 24 LTS as the primary runtime and supports Node.js 22.13+ as a compatibility runtime line.
- Setup, bootstrap, install, init, and reinit can recover from stale local bundle parity when they are run from the trusted source checkout, while remote-source setup and mutating lifecycle commands still fail closed.
- Update flows now record clearer trust and provenance evidence for npm, git, local path, and trust-override sources, and successful update output focuses on the applied version and operator-facing notes.
- `garda update`, `check-update --apply`, and `update git` now print compact user-facing result/source/safety/recovery sections instead of raw diagnostic key-value dumps, while keeping detailed provenance in reports and JSON output.
- `garda update`, `check-update --apply`, and `update git` stop before mutation when Garda is switched off, directing operators to run `garda on` first.
- `garda uninstall` now removes Garda-managed `.agentignore` active/off blocks without restoring stale install-time backups over later user edits.
- The package avoids consumer install lifecycle scripts; source checkout users run `npm run build` explicitly before using the generated launcher and compiled runtime.

### Task Workflow And Closeout
- Stale preflight, compile, rule-pack, review-context, review-gate, and full-suite evidence now routes through narrower recovery chains instead of retrying stale gates.
- `TASK.md` Active Queue preservation and gate-owned status sync now reflow the canonical 9-column table into a deterministic IDEA-compatible Markdown shape while preserving row values and lower local planning blocks.
- Successful `completion-gate` output now explicitly routes agents back to `next-step` and the `task-audit-summary` closeout before final report or commit-permission flow.
- After a successful `completion-gate`, `next-step` now reports missing final closeout artifacts instead of listing the already satisfied `completion-gate` as missing while routing to `task-audit-summary`.
- Zero-diff/no-op closeout diagnostics now omit full-suite artifacts that are disabled or intentionally not required, and omit absent completion-gate evidence once the current timeline has already passed completion.
- Final closeout and commit guidance now suppress commit commands when no tracked committable changes remain.
- Task reset, split-required, decomposed parent routing, and one-shot review-cycle continuation are now gate-owned runtime evidence instead of ad hoc `TASK.md` or workflow-config edits.

### Reviews And Validation
- Mandatory reviews require delegated fresh-context reviewer evidence with explicit routing, launch, invocation, receipt, and cleanup telemetry.
- `garda doctor` now includes a report-only large-module decomposition section that highlights the largest source/test files, large declarations, and matching open follow-up tasks.
- Ready-state task recommendations in `garda status`, `garda doctor`, and `agent-init` now resolve the first executable task from the canonical `TASK.md` Active Queue instead of falling back to `T-001`; terminal-only queues now print a clear no-executable-task message.
- Antigravity generated instructions now explicitly stop instead of fabricating independent review artifacts when no real provider sub-agent launch tool is available.
- Reviewer handoffs now include prompt/template/evidence/output paths plus exact verdict-token guidance, reducing malformed review outputs.
- Reviewer launch handoffs now use an immutable `ReviewerLaunchInputArtifactPath` for artifact-path mode, keeping the prepared input hash separate from the later completed launch artifact hash.
- Fresh reviewer launch attempts now receive hash-suffixed `ReviewOutputPath` files, so retry reviewers cannot accidentally append a new report into a stale prior attempt output.
- Reviewer launch help, next-step guidance, and completion-field hints now consistently name `ReviewerLaunchInputArtifactSha256` as the value for `--launch-input-sha256`, while keeping `launch_input_sha256` and `launch_input_artifact_sha256` clearly scoped as artifact JSON fields.
- `complete-reviewer-launch --record-invocation` now prints a complete `record-review-result` handoff command with current preflight, context, output source, execution mode, reviewer identity, and repo-root flags.
- `next-step` review-reuse hints now stay conservative until `build-review-context` validates current context/reuse hash eligibility, while still showing concrete candidates when current-context evidence can be safely rebound.
- Review reuse is stricter and more useful: PASS reviews can be reused only when receipt, provenance, tree state, scope fingerprints, and current-cycle bindings prove they are still valid.
- Strict-profile reviews are more evidence-aware, so DB/API/performance/infra/dependency lanes are not forced without matching domain surface evidence.
- Reviewer contexts now show current full-suite artifact freshness and duration, and tell reviewers when a current PASS suite already covers their lane without rerunning full tests.
- `record-review-result` now preserves existing canonical raw reviewer output on failed validation and replaces raw output, materialized artifacts, receipts, and review-recorded telemetry only after the accepted review result commits successfully.
- Compile-gate now rejects full-suite/test commands in its command block, while init and project discovery suggest stack-specific compile/build/type-check commands separately from full-suite validation commands.
- Compile-gate command selection can now be configured through `workflow-config.json`, `garda workflow set --compile-gate-command`, and the local UI settings editor, while unconfigured workspaces keep the legacy `40-commands.md` fallback.
- Full-suite validation, docs-only scopes, ordinary docs, and test-only deltas now have clearer routing so unnecessary expensive review/test cycles are avoided without weakening freshness checks.
- Full-suite timeout guidance now accounts for recent high-watermark runtime instead of relying only on averages, and external timeout cleanup now terminates child process trees more reliably.
- Task timeline diagnostics in `garda status`, `garda doctor`, and `repair rebuild-indexes` now distinguish invalid filenames, legacy incomplete histories, active incomplete blockers, and integrity failures with more specific repair guidance.

### Cleanup And Runtime Retention
- `garda html` now handles large runtime histories more quickly by rendering lazy or bounded task details by default.
- Backup inventory now has a backend model over existing rollback snapshots with date, reason, size, restore target, health, and latest-10 retention defaults.
- Scheduled auto-backups can now be configured through workflow config and run through the existing daily maintenance path, disabled by default with latest-10 retention.
- Confirmed manual backups now apply the configured `auto_backup.keep_latest` retention policy and report retention/prune results in CLI output and the local UI manual-backup status.
- Runtime cleanup now covers more generated zones, including temp, cache, report, update-temp, reviewer scratch, test scratch, metrics, and runtime tmp directories.
- Clean successful compile and full-suite runs omit heavy raw logs while retaining compact hash/count evidence; warnings, failures, and non-clean runs still keep detailed output.
- Retention and GC flows preserve active tasks and problem-task forensic evidence while allowing healthy DONE task artifacts to be compacted after ledger evidence exists.

### Release, Docs, And Package Contract
- Release validation now checks the sourceful distribution contract: published packages include the compiled runtime, canonical TypeScript source, templates, package metadata, and the public documentation surface needed by README/HOW_TO links.
- `release:preflight` now runs a short `test:release-smoke` runtime-contract suite after static readiness and before the expensive full release proof.
- Coverage scripts now use an explicit `c8` source-boundary config with `all=true`, reporting unexecuted maintained source while excluding generated build, coverage, runtime, dependency, and test trees.
- Release handoff archives now have separate `archive:source` and `archive:evidence` commands so clean source snapshots stay separate from generated proof artifacts and runtime reports.
- Package and bundle parity checks were tightened so releases can detect stale source, dist, template, package, and runtime-referenced documentation content before handoff.
- Embedded bundle parity validation now reports skipped status instead of an OK status when no parity items are checked.
- Documentation was aligned with the current Node runtime support, provider wording, lock-cleanup behavior, package files surface, and source-checkout build contract.

### Internal Hardening
- Protected control-plane checks, launcher delegation trust, offline-mode ordering, task-event integrity, update cache invalidation, and runtime lock recovery were hardened.
- Protected recovery handoff commands now include required operator-confirmation flags, so `next-step` and protected gate failures print copy-paste executable `enter-task-mode --orchestrator-work` restarts.
- Workflow-config preflight recovery now refreshes underscoped scopes when protected dirty-baseline files are still present outside the planned workflow-config change.
- Protected task-mode recovery now rebuilds planned changed-file scope from the current workspace snapshot instead of carrying stale planned files into the `enter-task-mode --orchestrator-work` restart command.
- Command dispatch, help discovery, workflow settings, profile selection, and optional-skill activation now fail closed in more ambiguous states.
- CI, release readiness, pack smoke, embedded bundle parity, and clean-worktree validation were expanded to better match the release path.

## 1.0.0
- first public Garda release
- renamed the public project line to Garda and reset the visible release history
- aligned the package version and workspace version files to `1.0.0`
- ships the current local agent orchestration runtime, gates, provider bridges, profiles, cleanup flows, and audit trail as the new baseline
