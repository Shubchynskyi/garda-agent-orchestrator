5. Run \`${buildBundleNextStepSnippet()}\` as the default task loop in deployed workspaces, or \`${buildSourceNextStepSnippet()}\` in this source checkout; rerun the same command after every suggested command.
6. Follow the shared checklist in \`.agents/workflows/start-task.md\` exactly.

10. ${REVIEWER_FRESH_CONTEXT_LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION}
11. ${ANTIGRAVITY_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE_STOP_INSTRUCTION}

# ${runtimeProviderLabel} Agent: Orchestrator

Canonical source of truth for agent workflow rules: \`${canonicalFile}\`.

Hard stop: first open \`${canonicalFile}\`, \`TASK.md\`, and \`.agents/workflows/start-task.md\`.

This provider profile is a strict bridge to Garda skills and the Node gate router.
Treat \`.agents/workflows/start-task.md\` as the shared router for every provider surface; it routes to canonical orchestration and does not replace \`80-task-workflow.md\`.
Use compact command protocol from \`40-commands.md\`: first \`scan\`, then \`inspect\`, then verbose \`debug\` only by exception.
Do not execute task or review workflow with provider-default reviewer agents that bypass this bridge.
Use \`${buildBundleNextStepSnippet()}\` as the default task loop in deployed workspaces, or \`${buildSourceNextStepSnippet()}\` in this source checkout. Run it before the first gate, after every suggested command, and after any gate failure.

## Non-Negotiable Priorities
- Honest execution and strict workflow compliance outrank speed, autonomy, context preservation, and token economy.
- Mandatory gate failure means stop or \`BLOCKED\`; never workaround the gate, batch around it, or synthesize missing evidence.
- Agent-authored scripts may automate ordinary repository work, but they must not batch, loop over, or green-light orchestrator gates or write review, receipt, routing, telemetry, status, or commit-readiness evidence unless the task itself is to change orchestrator code.
- Fabricated review artifacts, receipts, routing metadata, telemetry, task statuses, or commit-readiness claims are critical workflow violations.
- If asked about workflow misconduct or integrity defects, disclose the full known set from the current run, not only the latest discovered issue.

${buildTaskStartSnippetSection(runtimeProviderLabel, bridgePath)}

## Required Execution Contract
1. Read \`${canonicalFile}\` and its routing links before making changes.
2. Read \`TASK.md\` and select/create a task row before implementation.
3. Execute task workflow only in orchestrator mode: ${buildTaskStartNavigatorPrompt()}
4. ${buildFreshMainAgentStartBannerSentence()}
5. ${START_BANNER_GATE_LIST_RULE}
6. Use \`${buildSourceNextStepSnippet()}\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or \`${buildBundleNextStepSnippet()}\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace, as the command navigator before every numbered gate below.
7. ${OPTIONAL_MARKDOWN_WORKING_PLAN_INSTRUCTION}
8. ${buildDualCliActiveProfileGuidance(null)}
9. If the workspace already contains modified files before task-mode entry, stop and isolate scope via \`--use-staged\` or explicit \`--changed-file ...\` preflight inputs before continuing.
10. Enter task mode explicitly only when \`next-step\` tells you to do so: via \`node bin/garda.js gate enter-task-mode ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} enter-task-mode ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace; ${runtimeIdentityInstruction}.
11. Record baseline downstream rules explicitly when \`next-step\` requests it: via \`node bin/garda.js gate load-rule-pack ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} load-rule-pack ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.
12. Run handshake diagnostics when requested by \`next-step\`: via \`node bin/garda.js gate handshake-diagnostics ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} handshake-diagnostics ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.
13. Run shell smoke preflight when requested by \`next-step\`: via \`node bin/garda.js gate shell-smoke-preflight ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} shell-smoke-preflight ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.
14. Run preflight classification before implementation when requested by \`next-step\`: via \`node bin/garda.js gate classify-change ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} classify-change ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.
15. After preflight, refresh downstream rule-pack evidence when requested by \`next-step\`: via \`node bin/garda.js gate load-rule-pack --stage "POST_PREFLIGHT" ...\` when rules must be read, or \`node bin/garda.js gate bind-rule-pack-to-preflight ...\` when \`next-step\` says current-cycle rule files and hashes are already loaded. Use the matching \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()}\` command inside a materialized/deployed workspace, and preserve any custom \`--task-mode-path\` on both POST_PREFLIGHT rule-pack commands.
16. Run compile gate before review only after \`next-step\` reports it as the next gate: via \`node bin/garda.js gate compile-gate ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} compile-gate ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.
17. Before each required review, run \`node bin/garda.js gate build-review-context ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} build-review-context ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace, only when \`next-step\` names that review; that step auto-emits \`REVIEW_PHASE_STARTED\`, \`SKILL_SELECTED\`, and \`SKILL_REFERENCE_LOADED\`. ${REVIEWER_FRESH_CONTEXT_LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION} ${REVIEWER_CLEANUP_AFTER_RECEIPT_INSTRUCTION} Dependent downstream review preparation or reviewer launch must wait until the required upstream PASS artifact and receipt exist for the same cycle.
18. Do not fan out known producer-consumer validation commands as raw shell sidecars around the gate flow. Flows such as \`npm run build:node-foundation\` -> direct \`node --test .node-build/...\` must use the guarded workflow path or run strictly sequentially, never in parallel.
19. Run required independent reviews and gates via \`node bin/garda.js gate required-reviews-check ...\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} required-reviews-check ...\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace; only independent review types may fan out in parallel for the same cycle. If a cycle changed only test scope, materialize reusable upstream \`code\` review evidence before launching \`test\`, then run \`doc-impact-gate\`, then \`completion-gate\` before marking \`DONE\`.
20. Update task status and artifacts in \`TASK.md\`.
21. Log or inspect lifecycle events by task id via \`node bin/garda.js gate log-task-event ...\` / \`task-events-summary\` in a self-hosted source checkout, or via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} log-task-event ...\` / \`task-events-summary\` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.

## Reviewer Launch Mapping (Mandatory Delegation)
- Every provider must spawn each required reviewer as a fresh-context sub-agent; same-agent self-review is invalid for mandatory reviews.
${getDelegationRequiredProviderLaunchLines().join('\n')}
- Routing and prepare may use only the planned \`agent:pending:<task-id>-<review-type>\` identity; record the resolved provider \`agent:*\` identity only with \`record-reviewer-delegation-started\` after the real reviewer launch.
- Providers or bridges without delegated reviewer support are not eligible to satisfy the mandatory review workflow until delegated launch support exists.
- ${REVIEWER_SESSION_REUSE_BOUNDARY_INSTRUCTION}
- ${REVIEWER_CLEANUP_AFTER_RECEIPT_INSTRUCTION}
- Dependency order is a launch-time contract even on delegation-capable platforms: do not launch a dependent downstream reviewer before the required upstream PASS artifact and receipt exist for the same cycle.
- Parallel reviewer fan-out is allowed only between independent review types with no dependency edge for the current cycle.
- ${REVIEW_LAUNCH_NAVIGATION_INSTRUCTION}
- Each review receipt must include \`reviewer_execution_mode\` (\`delegated_subagent\`) and \`reviewer_identity\` (\`agent:...\`). Receipts that do not preserve this delegated reviewer contract cannot satisfy a fresh mandatory review cycle.

## Skill Routing
- Orchestration: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/orchestration/SKILL.md\`
- Code review: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/code-review/SKILL.md\`
- DB review: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/db-review/SKILL.md\`
- Security review: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/security-review/SKILL.md\`
- Refactor review: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/refactor-review/SKILL.md\`

## Dynamic Skill Discovery (Required)
- Canonical skill list: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/docs/agent-rules/90-skill-catalog.md\`
- Optional-skill capability flags: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/config/review-capabilities.json\`
- Token-economy controls: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/config/token-economy.json\`
- Output-filter profiles: \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/config/output-filters.json\`
- Include specialist skills added after initialization from \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/**\` when required by preflight and capability flags.

## Task Timeline Logging (Required)
- Event logger: \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} log-task-event ...\`
- Log file (per task): \`${resolveBundleName()}/runtime/task-events/<task-id>.jsonl\`
- Aggregate log: \`${resolveBundleName()}/runtime/task-events/all-tasks.jsonl\`

Bridge path for this provider: \`${bridgePath}\`.

# Start Task

This checklist is the shared start-task router for root entrypoints and provider bridges.
It routes to the canonical Garda workflow and does not replace \`80-task-workflow.md\` or the orchestration skill.

Before any code changes:
- Open \`${canonicalFile}\` and \`TASK.md\`.
- If an active provider bridge exists, open it too before implementation.
- ${buildFreshMainAgentStartBannerSentence()}
- ${START_BANNER_GATE_LIST_RULE}
- ${START_BANNER_EXEMPTION_RULE}
- Enter orchestrator mode with the canonical command: ${buildTaskStartNavigatorPrompt()}
- ${buildNextStepNavigatorGuidance('node bin/garda.js')} In deployed workspaces use \`${buildBundleNextStepSnippet()}\`.
- Do not start by guessing \`compile-gate\`, \`classify-change\`, or default config flags. Static gate order below is policy context; \`next-step\` is the executable navigator.
- ${OPTIONAL_MARKDOWN_WORKING_PLAN_INSTRUCTION}
- ${buildDualCliActiveProfileGuidance(null)}
- If the workspace already contains modified files before task-mode entry, stop and isolate scope via \`--use-staged\` or explicit \`--changed-file ...\` preflight inputs before continuing.
- Agents cannot approve protected task-mode entry for themselves. Any rerun with \`--orchestrator-work\` or \`--workflow-config-work\` requires a fresh operator approval, \`--operator-confirmed yes\`, and \`--operator-confirmed-at-utc "<ISO-8601 timestamp>"\`.
- In materialized/application workspaces, the Garda bundle is vendor/control-plane. When \`garda_self_guard\` is on, agents must not self-escalate into \`--orchestrator-work\`; route protected Garda bundle edits to operator-owned update/repair/maintenance or an explicit \`workflow set --garda-self-guard off\` policy change.
- Use compact command protocol from \`40-commands.md\`: first \`scan\`, then \`inspect\`, then verbose \`debug\` only by exception.

${buildTaskStartSnippetSection(runtimeProviderPlaceholder, routePlaceholder)}

Mandatory gate order:
0. \`next-step "<task-id>"\` before the first gate and after every gate; run only the single recommended command it prints unless the user explicitly asks for diagnostics
1. \`gate enter-task-mode\` with explicit runtime identity via \`--provider "<provider>"\`; add \`--routed-to "<provider-bridge-or-entrypoint>"\` only when route telemetry must be pinned, and never rely on canonical SourceOfTruth fallback
2. \`gate load-rule-pack --stage TASK_ENTRY\`
3. \`gate handshake-diagnostics\`
4. \`gate shell-smoke-preflight\`
5. \`gate classify-change\`
6. POST_PREFLIGHT rule-pack command printed by \`next-step\`: \`gate load-rule-pack --stage POST_PREFLIGHT\` or \`gate bind-rule-pack-to-preflight\`
7. implement only after preflight
8. \`gate compile-gate\`
9. \`gate build-review-context\` for each required review
10. \`gate required-reviews-check\`
11. \`gate doc-impact-gate\`
12. \`gate full-suite-validation\` (when enabled via workflow-config.json)
13. \`gate completion-gate\`

Hard stops:
- If a mandatory gate fails or is unavailable, stop and report the exact command and stderr.
- If \`next-step\` or a failed gate says \`--orchestrator-work\`, \`--workflow-config-work\`, or \`workflow set\` is required, stop for explicit operator approval before running the command with \`--operator-confirmed yes\` and \`--operator-confirmed-at-utc "<ISO-8601 timestamp>"\` where required.
- If \`next-step\` reports \`operator-maintenance\` because Garda self-guard is on, do not rerun task mode with \`--orchestrator-work\`; an operator must run update/repair/maintenance or deliberately relax the guard.
- Do not make code edits before \`enter-task-mode\`; unscoped pre-task diffs must be isolated first.
- ${REVIEWER_FRESH_CONTEXT_LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION}
- ${REVIEWER_DELEGATION_STARTED_INSTRUCTION}
- ${REVIEWER_SESSION_REUSE_BOUNDARY_INSTRUCTION}
- ${REVIEWER_CLEANUP_AFTER_RECEIPT_INSTRUCTION}
- Do not spawn or pre-launch a dependent downstream reviewer before the required upstream PASS artifact and receipt exist for the same cycle.
- Parallel reviewer fan-out is allowed only between independent review types with no dependency edge.
- ${REVIEW_LAUNCH_NAVIGATION_INSTRUCTION}
- Do not fan out known producer-consumer validation commands as raw shell sidecars. Flows such as \`npm run build:node-foundation\` -> direct \`node --test .node-build/...\` must use the guarded workflow path or run strictly sequentially, never in parallel.
- Do not hand-edit active \`TASK.md\` lifecycle statuses (\`IN_PROGRESS\`, \`IN_REVIEW\`, \`DONE\`, \`BLOCKED\`) as a substitute for gates; completion finalization owns \`DONE\`, review-gate owns \`IN_REVIEW\`, task-mode owns \`IN_PROGRESS\`, and explicit operator \`task-reset\` owns reset/discard.
- Do not mark \`DONE\` without \`COMPLETION_GATE_PASSED\`.
- Do not create fake review artifacts or bypass reviewer routing.
- The \`40-commands.md\` restraint applies only to standalone ad-hoc commands. It does NOT exempt mandatory gates: gates such as \`compile-gate\` and \`full-suite-validation\` must execute their underlying build/test/type-check commands when the workflow requires them.

## Skill Bridge Contract
- Use this profile only as a bridge to skill: \`${skillPath}\`

- Capability flag gate: \`${capabilityFlag}\`
- Re-read \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/docs/agent-rules/90-skill-catalog.md\` before execution.
- Re-read \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/config/review-capabilities.json\` before execution.
- Re-read \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/config/token-economy.json\` before execution.
- Re-read \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/config/output-filters.json\` before execution.
- Keep downstream rule-pack evidence current via \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} load-rule-pack ...\`; bridge execution is invalid without recorded rule-file loading.
- Reviewer preparation must run \`${getNodeGateCommandPrefix()} build-review-context --review-type "<review-type>" ...\` before verdict capture; completion for code-changing tasks validates the resulting review-skill telemetry.
- Downstream \`test\` review must wait for current-cycle PASS evidence from required upstream non-\`test\` reviews; on pure test-scope reruns, materialize reusable upstream \`code\` review evidence first.
- On \`${reviewSkillBridgeHost.providerLabel}\`, spawn reviewer helper tasks via \`task\` tool with \`agent_type="general-purpose"\` and isolated context; same-agent self-review is invalid on this delegation-capable provider. ${REVIEWER_SESSION_REUSE_BOUNDARY_INSTRUCTION}
- ${REVIEWER_CLEANUP_AFTER_RECEIPT_INSTRUCTION}
- Honor specialist skills added after initialization under \`${resolveBundleName()}/live/skills/**\`.
- Record review routing and outcomes only through the review gates; \`log-task-event\` cannot emit reviewer provenance events.
- Task timeline path (per task): \`${resolveBundleName()}/runtime/task-events/<task-id>.jsonl\`.
- Review verdicts and completion status are recorded only through orchestrator workflow.
- Never mark task \`DONE\` from this profile; hand off to \`${reviewSkillBridgeHost.bridgePath}\`.
