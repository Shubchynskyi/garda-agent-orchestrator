The command must identify the one exact check target. Its authenticated changed-file evidence must explain why that target is relevant, but a passed no-findings result does not need to repeat the target path outside the command.',

If it exposes an actual defect or test failure, report that defect as an ordinary severity finding rather than as evidence-only F-000, link the failed validation note to the exact ordinary finding through finding_ids, and reuse at least one exact changed-file evidence location from each linked finding in that note.',
