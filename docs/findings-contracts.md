# Findings-Only Review Contracts and Legacy Migration

This guide describes the review-result contract used by new Garda task cycles,
the artifacts derived from it, and the supported migration path for older
profiles and review history. Use `garda next-step <task-id>` as the navigator;
the examples below explain the contract but do not replace its task-specific
commands.

## Contract Surfaces

| Surface | Canonical location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Shipped JSON Schema | `template/schemas/review-findings-report.schema.json` | Package/source contract for a reviewer result. |
| Installed JSON Schema | `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/schemas/review-findings-report.schema.json` | Materialized copy used by the workspace. |
| Human contract | `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md` | Explains the generated findings-only handoff. |
| Generated reviewer files | `garda-agent-orchestrator/runtime/reviews/<task-id>-<review-type>-{role-prompt,prompt-template,output-template,evidence-manifest}.*` | Immutable, task- and cycle-bound reviewer instructions. |
| Reviewer scratch output | Exact `ReviewOutputPath` printed by `prepare-reviewer-launch` | The reviewer's only permitted write. |

The shipped and installed schemas are Garda-managed. Materialization refreshes
the canonical filename but preserves unrelated user-owned files under
`live/schemas/`.

## Reviewer Output

A reviewer in a new cycle returns exactly one JSON object. It reports evidence
and findings only; it does not decide the verdict, disposition, remediation,
follow-up, profile, or downstream task state. The generated output template is
the authoritative fill-in form for the cycle.

The following is a schema-valid empty-findings example. Its hashes and coverage
obligations are illustrative and must be replaced with the exact values from
the generated handoff; copying this example into a real cycle will fail its
binding and complete-coverage checks.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "task_id": "T-001",
  "review_type": "code",
  "review_context_sha256": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "tree_state_sha256": "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
  "validation_notes": [
    {
      "id": "N-001",
      "topic": "complete-scope-sweep",
      "note": "Reviewed the changed behavior and its focused regression.",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "location": "src/example.ts:10",
          "observation": "The changed branch preserves the documented boundary."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "coverage_ledger": {
    "coverage_contract_sha256": "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc",
    "entries": [
      {
        "obligation_id": "FILE-001",
        "evidence": [
          {
            "location": "src/example.ts:10",
            "observation": "The changed file was reviewed."
          }
        ],
        "finding_ids": []
      }
    ]
  },
  "findings": {
    "critical": [],
    "high": [],
    "medium": [],
    "low": []
  },
  "residual_risks": [],
  "reviewer_notes": []
}
```

Deterministic ingestion checks all of the following before accepting the
result:

- the JSON Schema and exact top-level fields;
- task id, review type, review-context hash, and tree-state hash bindings;
- every generated coverage obligation exactly once with concrete changed-file
  `path:line` evidence;
- bidirectional links between each active `F-NNN` finding and its coverage
  obligations;
- reviewer identity, launch input, routing, and current-cycle receipt bindings;
- absence of reviewer-authored verdict, status, disposition, remediation, and
  follow-up fields.

An empty findings object is findings-satisfied only after these checks pass.
Malformed output is not a finding and does not become pass evidence.

## Derived Artifacts and Policy

`record-review-result` preserves the exact reviewer output and derives the
remaining state under orchestrator ownership:

| Artifact | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<task-id>-<review-type>-review-output.md` | Exact persisted reviewer JSON. |
| `<task-id>-<review-type>-findings-validation.json` | Deterministic validation result and hashes. |
| `<task-id>-<review-type>-findings-disposition.json` | Locked profile-policy action for every accepted finding or residual risk. |
| `<task-id>-<review-type>-receipt.json` | Authenticated references to launch, output, validation, and disposition evidence. |
| `<task-id>-<review-type>-findings-follow-ups.json` | Idempotent follow-up materialization evidence when required. |

The active profile's `review_finding_policy` and
`review_follow_up_policy` are copied into the task profile-policy snapshot at
task entry. Later profile changes affect future tasks only. A current receipt
is accepted only when its validation and disposition artifacts still match
their recorded paths, hashes, result hashes, task cycle, and review tree.

Built-in finding actions are:

- `soft`: fix critical; create follow-ups for high; ignore medium, low, and
  residual risks;
- `balanced`: fix critical, high, and medium; create follow-ups for low and
  residual risks;
- `strict`: fix every finding and residual risk in the current task.

`fix_now` items keep the lane findings-unsatisfied. `create_follow_up` items are
materialized only from accepted validation/disposition evidence. With
`grouped_by_parent`, Garda waits for all required lanes and creates one pending
F-task for the parent; with `per_finding`, it creates one F-task per item.
Repeated materialization is idempotent, and warning text never creates work.

Use the path and command printed by `next-step`. A representative explicit
ingestion command is:

```bash
garda gate record-review-result \
  --task-id "T-001" \
  --review-type "code" \
  --preflight-path "garda-agent-orchestrator/runtime/reviews/T-001-preflight.json" \
  --review-output-path "garda-agent-orchestrator/runtime/tmp/reviews/T-001/code/review-output.md" \
  --reviewer-execution-mode "delegated_subagent" \
  --reviewer-identity "agent:<provider-reviewer-id>" \
  --repo-root "."
```

When a validated disposition requires follow-up materialization, the explicit
gate form is:

```bash
garda gate materialize-review-follow-up-tasks \
  --task-id "T-001" \
  --review-type "code" \
  --disposition-artifact-path "garda-agent-orchestrator/runtime/reviews/T-001-code-findings-disposition.json" \
  --repo-root "."
```

## Selective Remediation and Recovery

After a `fix_now` finding, change only the required implementation/test scope
and rerun `garda next-step <task-id>`. When recovery is eligible, the navigator
prints one `restart-review-cycle` command. Its impact analysis classifies the
remediation as `test_coverage_only`, `test_hook_isolation`, `api_surface`,
`runtime_behavior`, `security_sensitive`, `refactor_structure`, or fail-closed
`unknown`.

The remediation baseline binds the prior validation/disposition inventory,
receipt, tree state, and changed-file groups. Garda may preserve a prior
findings-satisfied lane only when its authenticated scope remains valid;
affected or ambiguous lanes receive fresh contexts and fresh delegated
reviewers in dependency order.

Representative command shape:

```bash
garda gate restart-review-cycle \
  --task-id "T-001" \
  --task-intent "Fix the accepted code-review finding" \
  --changed-file "src/example.ts" \
  --impact-analysis "Changed the reported branch only; related tests remain in scope; no unrelated blocker or follow-up decision changed." \
  --repo-root "."
```

Do not edit receipts, validation/disposition artifacts, launch metadata,
task-event journals, or remediation baselines manually. If a hash or binding is
stale, rerun `next-step` and use its recovery command. This preserves valid
lane evidence without silently accepting stale output.

## Legacy Migration

Legacy data remains readable, but it never becomes current evidence merely
because it can be parsed.

| Legacy state | Runtime behavior and diagnostic | Supported operator action |
|---|---|---|
| Profile missing `review_finding_policy` | Resolves fail-closed to `strict` and reports `missing review_finding_policy; resolved fail-closed to strict`. | Preview and apply an explicit policy with the guarded CLI below. |
| Profile missing `review_follow_up_policy` | Defaults compatibly to `per_finding` and reports `missing review_follow_up_policy; defaulted compatibly to per_finding`. | Add the explicit validated policy block for future tasks, then run `garda profile validate`. There is no automatic conversion to grouped mode. |
| Existing task snapshot missing either policy | Uses its recorded compatibility fallback and emits snapshot diagnostics. | Do not rewrite the active snapshot. Finish it under the locked fallback; migrated profiles apply to newly entered tasks. |
| Heading-based Markdown or PASS/FAIL verdict artifact | Readable as historical audit data only; rejected for a current findings-only context. | Preserve it, rerun `next-step`, and launch the one fresh reviewer requested for the current generated context. |
| Tampered/missing validation, disposition, receipt, or launch binding | Fails closed with the mismatched path/hash/binding in diagnostics. | Preserve evidence and follow the single recovery command from `next-step`; never reconstruct or hand-edit proof. |

To make a legacy finding policy explicit, first preview the intended preset:

```bash
garda profile policy preview <profile-name> --preset balanced --json
```

Then apply the same candidate with all three hashes from that preview and fresh
operator confirmation:

```bash
garda profile policy apply <profile-name> --preset balanced \
  --expected-policy-sha256 "<policy_sha256>" \
  --expected-plan-sha256 "<plan_sha256>" \
  --expected-config-sha256 "<before_config_sha256>" \
  --operator-confirmed yes \
  --operator-confirmed-at-utc "<ISO-8601 timestamp>"
```

To opt a legacy profile into grouped follow-ups for future tasks, add this
validated profile field through the repository's normal configuration-change
workflow and validate the complete profile file:

```json
{
  "review_follow_up_policy": {
    "schema_version": 1,
    "materialization_mode": "grouped_by_parent"
  }
}
```

```bash
garda profile validate
```

This is an explicit configuration migration, not an `update`/`init`
auto-migration. Existing task snapshots keep their original policy and hashes.

## Existing Identity and Timing Diagnostics

Findings validation does not add a provider adapter, launch another reviewer,
or replace launch/timing checks. The existing delegated-review launch records
the provider-owned `agent:` identity and invocation evidence; the accepted
receipt binds that launch to the result. `garda gate task-audit-summary` reports
attempt counts and review timing from those existing artifacts. A timing
warning is advisory and cannot create a finding, follow-up, provider action, or
extra review by itself.

For any blocked state, run:

```bash
garda next-step T-001
```

Use only its single command. Do not recover by adding a verdict to findings
JSON, copying an older receipt, inventing a provider action, or launching an
extra reviewer outside the current dependency graph.
