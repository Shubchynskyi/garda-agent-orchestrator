# Branch Protection Guidance

## Overview

The orchestrator enforces **local** protected-path integrity at task
completion time (see [Orchestrator Work and Isolation](orchestrator-work-and-isolation.md)).
GitHub **branch protection rules** and **CODEOWNERS** extend that
enforcement to the **PR-merge** boundary so that changes to critical
paths cannot land without the right approvals, passing CI, and a clean
merge target.

Together the two layers form a defence-in-depth governance model:

| Layer | When | What it guards |
|---|---|---|
| **Local protected-path enforcement** | Task completion gate | Orchestrator control-plane files in the worktree. |
| **CODEOWNERS + branch protection** | Pull request merge | The same files, plus CI workflows, security config, and package metadata. |

## Recommended Branch Protection Settings

Apply these settings to every long-lived branch (`main`, `dev`,
`release/*`) through **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**
in the GitHub repository.

### Required Checks

| Setting | Recommended value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Require status checks to pass before merging** | ✅ Enabled | Prevents merging when CI is red. |
| **Require branches to be up to date before merging** | ✅ Enabled | Ensures the PR branch includes the latest target commits. |
| **Status checks that are required** | `ci` (the main CI workflow) | At minimum, the primary build/test workflow must pass. |

### Release Security Required Checks

Use the existing security workflows as the release-security baseline; do
not add a duplicate security pipeline for release branches. Label every
retained check as either `blocking` or `informational` so branch
protection and release-readiness diagnostics stay explicit.

| Check | Label | Branch-protection guidance | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CI` / release validation matrix | `blocking` | Required | Proves build, test shards, package smoke, release readiness, and lifecycle smoke. |
| `Security / npm audit` | `blocking` | Required | Fails on high or critical production dependency advisories. |
| `Secret Scanning / Gitleaks` | `blocking` | Required | Prevents committed secrets from reaching protected branches. |
| `Security / OSV Vulnerability Scan` | `informational` | Optional required check | Keeps SARIF-backed vulnerability visibility; make it required only when the team accepts upstream advisory noise as merge-blocking. |
| `SBOM / Generate SBOM` | `informational` | Optional required check | Produces the CycloneDX artifact for release evidence; artifact absence is still surfaced by the workflow itself. |

### GitHub Action pinning decision

The CI and security workflows remain version-tag pinned (`actions/*@v6`,
`actions/upload-artifact@v4`, `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2`, and
`google/osv-scanner-action/...@v2.3.0`) and are intentionally not SHA-pinned
at this time. This is an operator-maintainability tradeoff,
not a provenance guarantee. Release-sensitive operators should review
action update diffs before broadening branch protection, and this
decision does not replace future provenance or release-signing work.

### Update-source policy reporting

Release updates report the update-source trust policy separately from
PR-time branch protection. The readiness baseline expects these statuses
to remain visible:

| Status | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NPM_REGISTRY_INTEGRITY_RECORDED` | `informational` | Preferred npm update path recorded exact package and registry integrity metadata. |
| `TRUSTED_GIT_NO_RELEASE_SIGNATURE` | `informational` | Allowlisted git source passed trust policy, but no release signature was verified. |
| `TRUST_OVERRIDE_UNVERIFIED` | `informational` | Operator override bypassed trusted-source enforcement and must stay local/dev recovery only. |

### Required Reviews

| Setting | Recommended value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Require pull request reviews before merging** | ✅ Enabled | At least one human or designated reviewer must approve. |
| **Required number of approvals** | `1` (increase for high-risk branches) | Balances velocity with oversight. |
| **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed** | ✅ Enabled | Forces re-review after changes. |
| **Require review from Code Owners** | ✅ Enabled | Enforces CODEOWNERS approval for protected paths. |

### Merge Restrictions

| Setting | Recommended value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Require signed commits** | Optional | Useful for supply-chain assurance but may add contributor friction. |
| **Require linear history** | Optional | Keeps the commit graph clean when squash/rebase merge is preferred. |
| **Include administrators** | ✅ Enabled | Prevents admin bypass of protection rules. |
| **Restrict who can push to matching branches** | ✅ Enabled | Limits direct pushes to the CI bot and release automation only. |

### Force Push and Deletion

| Setting | Recommended value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Allow force pushes** | ❌ Disabled | Protects branch history from rewriting. |
| **Allow deletions** | ❌ Disabled | Prevents accidental branch deletion. |

## CODEOWNERS Integration

The repository includes a `.github/CODEOWNERS` file whose path patterns
mirror the orchestrator's local protected-path list. When **Require
review from Code Owners** is enabled in branch protection, GitHub
automatically requests reviews from the listed owners for any PR that
touches those paths.

### Covered paths

- **Orchestrator runtime** — `runtime/`,
  `garda-agent-orchestrator/runtime/`,
  `live/docs/agent-rules/`,
  `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/docs/agent-rules/`,
  `live/config/`,
  `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/config/`,
  `live/skills/`,
  `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/skills/`
- **Source checkout roots** — `src/`, `garda-agent-orchestrator/src/`,
  `bin/`, `garda-agent-orchestrator/bin/`, `dist/`,
  `garda-agent-orchestrator/dist/`, `template/`,
  `garda-agent-orchestrator/template/`
- **CI workflows** — `.github/workflows/`
- **Security config** — `SECURITY.md`, `.gitleaks.toml`
- **Agent entrypoints** — `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
  `.github/agents/`, `.agents/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`
- **Package metadata** — `package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
  `tsconfig*.json`

### Customising owners

This checkout uses `@Shubchynskyi` in `.github/CODEOWNERS`. If you fork
the repository, replace that owner handle with your actual GitHub team
handle or individual user handles. Multiple owners can be listed
space-separated:

```text
src/   @your-org/core-team @your-username
```

The local gate catches accidental control-plane drift **before** the PR
is even created.  Branch protection and CODEOWNERS catch anything that
bypasses or post-dates the local gate.

## Quick Setup Checklist

1. [ ] Confirm `.github/CODEOWNERS` exists and paths are correct.
2. [ ] Confirm the owner handles in `.github/CODEOWNERS` match this
   checkout or your fork's maintainers.
3. [ ] Enable **Require pull request reviews before merging** on target branches.
4. [ ] Enable **Require review from Code Owners**.
5. [ ] Add the main CI workflow as a **required status check**.
6. [ ] Enable **Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed**.
7. [ ] Enable **Include administrators** to prevent bypass.
8. [ ] Disable **Allow force pushes** and **Allow deletions**.
