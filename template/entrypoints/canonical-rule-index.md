# Garda Agent Orchestrator Rule Index

This file can serve as the source of truth for agent workflow rules.
At setup, source of truth is selected via `-SourceOfTruth` (`Claude`, `Codex`, `Cursor`, `Gemini`, `Qwen`, `GitHubCopilot`, `Windsurf`, `Junie`, or `Antigravity`).
Non-selected entrypoint files must only redirect to the selected source-of-truth file.

## How To Use This File
1. Always read `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/docs/agent-rules/00-core.md`.
2. Read only the linked rule files required for the current task.
3. Avoid loading unrelated rule files to save context and tokens.
4. Use compact command protocol from `40-commands.md`: first `scan`, then `inspect`, then verbose `debug` only by exception.
5. The `40-commands.md` restraint applies only to standalone ad-hoc commands. It does NOT exempt mandatory gates: gates like `compile-gate` and `full-suite-validation` must execute their underlying build/test/type-check commands when the workflow requires them. See `00-core.md` § Mandatory Infrastructure Integrity.

## Hard Stop For Task Execution
- Before implementing any task, open `TASK.md`.
- Before implementing any task, open `.agents/workflows/start-task.md`.
- Do not execute task work until this canonical file and `TASK.md` are both read.
- Treat `.agents/workflows/start-task.md` as the shared start-task router for root entrypoints and provider bridges; it routes to the canonical workflow and does not replace `80-task-workflow.md`.
- Execute tasks only through orchestration workflow (`Execute task <task-id> from TASK.md strictly through all mandatory orchestrator gates.`), with preflight and required review gates.
- Fresh main-agent task run must emit exactly one English start banner from the repo-owned list before any edit.
- Reviewer agents, sub-agents, sidecars, and resumed cycles that already passed the start-banner step must not repeat it.
- Mandatory required reviewer launches must spawn a new clean-context delegated reviewer for the current review context; do not reuse an existing reviewer session.
- After the review receipt is persisted, close or release the reviewer sub-agent session.
- Use the active profile as the default execution mode; explicit `depth=<1|2|3>` is only a one-run override.
- If the workspace already contains modified files before task-mode entry and the run is not isolated through staged or explicit scope, stop and treat the start as invalid.
- After opening downstream workflow files (`40-commands.md`, `80-task-workflow.md`, `90-skill-catalog.md`, and any risk-specific rule pack), record them via `node bin/garda.js gate load-rule-pack ...` in a self-hosted source checkout, or `node garda-agent-orchestrator/bin/garda.js gate load-rule-pack ...` inside a materialized/deployed workspace.
- If provider-native agent directories are available, execute through provider bridge profiles (`.github/agents/orchestrator.md`, `.windsurf/agents/orchestrator.md`, `.junie/agents/orchestrator.md`, `.antigravity/agents/orchestrator.md`).
- Provider bridge profiles must resolve skills from `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/docs/agent-rules/90-skill-catalog.md` and `garda-agent-orchestrator/live/config/review-capabilities.json` (including skills added after init).
